    The `GaussianSplatOptimizer` uses a threshold on the accumulated norm of 2D mean gradients to use during refinement.

    There are several modes for computing this threshold, specified by the config:
    - CONSTANT: Always use the fixed threshold specified by self._config.insertion_grad_2d_threshold.
    - PERCENTILE_FIRST_ITERATION: During the first refinement step, set the threshold to the given percentile of the gradients.
        For all subsequent refinement steps, use that fixed threshold.
    - PERCENTILE_EVERY_ITERATION: During every refinement step, set the threshold to the given percentile of the gradients.

    These modes let you adapt the refinement behavior to the statistics of the gradients during training.
    Generally CONSTANT with a default value (0.0002) will produce okay results, but may not be optimal for all types
    of captures. Using PERCENTILE_FIRST_ITERATION will have similar behavior to CONSTANT but will adapt to the scale of the gradients
    which can be more robust across different capture types.
    For highly detailed scenes, PERCENTILE_EVERY_ITERATION may be useful to adaptively insert more Gaussians as the model learns more detail.
    This generally produces many more Gaussians and more detailed results at the cost of more memory and compute.

            be split into multiple copies.

          - We split a Gaussian when its 3D size exceeds a threshold value and the gradient of its projected mean over time is high on average.
            In this case, a Gaussian is likely too large for the amount of detail it represents and should be split to capture detail in the image.

        Compute the threshold on the accumulated norm of 2D mean gradients to use during refinement.

        There are several modes for computing this threshold, specified by the config:
        - CONSTANT: Always use the fixed threshold specified by self._config.insertion_grad_2d_threshold.
        - PERCENTILE_FIRST_ITERATION: During the first refinement step, set the threshold to the given percentile of the gradients.

        - PERCENTILE_EVERY_ITERATION: During every refinement step, set the threshold to the given percentile of the gradients.

        These modes let you adapt the refinement behavior to the statistics of the gradients during training.
        Generally CONSTANT with a default value (0.0002) will produce okay results, but may not be optimal for all types
        of captures. Using PERCENTILE_FIRST_ITERATION will have similar behavior to CONSTANT but will adapt to the scale of the gradients
        which can be more robust across different capture types.
        For highly detailed scenes, PERCENTILE_EVERY_ITERATION may be useful to adaptively insert more Gaussians as the model learns more detail.
        This generally produces many more Gaussians and more detailed results at the cost of more memory and compute.
